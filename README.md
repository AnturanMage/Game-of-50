# Game-of-50
A Python program dedicated to simulating the mathematical Game of 50 when one of the players is using both a random strategy and a mathematically undefeatable strategy.

Once the program has begun, input 0 to choose the random strategy for player 1 or input 1 to choose the undefeatable strategy for player 1.
Then, input the number of game iterations who wish for the program to run.
Ensure that you press enter after each of your inputs.
When the results have been printed, scroll up or down the output box to view them.
Press y once the program has finished to restart it. Press n to end the program.

If you wish to use this program for any other project or reason, please contact me.
